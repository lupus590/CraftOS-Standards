## 1. Abstract
This document defines and details the algorithms behind Universal Compressed Graphics, a file format for storing images
and graphics, designed to be used with ComputerCraft and CraftOS 2.

## 2. Quick Overview

| Name       | Value             |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Version    | 1.0.0             |
| Type       | UCG Image         |
| MIME       | ``image/ucg``     |
| Extensions | ``.ucg``          |

## 3. Introduction & Purpose
The goal of this file format is to introduce a way for storing bitmaps in a very compact way, while keeping the
decompression time as short as possible. To achieve this, UCG uses a combination
of [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)
& [run-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding). Tests have shown that an average image
stored using UCG is about 10-40% the size of the same image stored using the ComputerCraft paintutils format.

Familiarity with the technique of Huffman coding is required to create a working encoder, but not necessarily required
(while being highly recommended) to understand the UCG format.

## 4. Specification
**UCGFile** = FileHeader + ImageHeader + ImageData

FileHeader = Signature + Version

Signature = *(3 bytes)* `0xFF2137`
Version = *(1 byte)* `0x01`

ImageHeader = Flags + Width + Height

Flags = *(1 byte)*
Width = *(1 word)*
Height = *(1 word)*

ImageData = ColorHuffmanTree + LengthHuffmanTree + PixelData
ColorHuffmanTree = *(HuffmanTree with value type `ColorValue`)*
LengthHuffmanTree = *(HuffmanTree with value type `LengthValue`)*
PixelData = *(PixelData)*

### 4.1 Definitions
#### 4.1.1 Byte
Bytes (also called "Octets") stored within a computer do not have a "bit order", since they are always treated as a
unit. However, a byte considered as an integer between 0 and 255 does have a most- and least-significant bit, and since
we write numbers with the most-significant digit on the left, we also write bytes with the most-significant bit on the
left.

In the diagram below, we number the bits of a byte so that bit 0 is the least-significant bit, i.e.,
(= [MSB 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_numbering)) and the left-most bit is the one being processed first. the
bits are numbered:

```
+--------+
|76543210|
+--------+
```

Within a computer, a number may occupy multiple bytes. All multi-byte numbers in the format described here are stored in
Big-endian.

#### 4.1.2 Word
The type `word` means an unsigned 2-byte integer in this document.

#### 4.1.3 `ColorValue`
A data element with the type "`ColorValue`" is a 5bit binary integer, storing the values from 0 to 32. If x (the value
of this 5bit number) is less than 16, the real integer value of the `ColorValue` is simply `2^x`. If x _equals_ 16, the
object it is associated with is transparent. (In this case, the pixel/pixel row is transparent). All other possible
values are unused and reserved for later usage.

#### 4.1.4 `LengthValue`
A data element with the type "`LengthValue`" is a dynamically-sized binary integer, capable of storing the values from 0
up to 65535. The first part of a `LengthValue` is a 4bit number.

If this 4bit number x is less than 13, it is the final value of the `LengthValue`. If x _equals_ 13, a 5bit number
follows that describes the value. If x equals 14, a 8bit number follows that describes the value. If x equals 15, a
16bit number follows that describes the value.

The diagram below may explain this better:

| value of the first 4bit Number | the number that follows |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 1, 2, 3, ... 10, 11, 12        | none                    |
| 13                             | a 5bit number           |
| 14                             | a 8bit number           |
| 15                             | a 16bit number          |

Here's an example function that would read a `LengthValue`:

```lua
function readLengthValue(inputstream)
	local firstNumber = inputstream.readNumber(4)
		-- the argument of the readNumber function specifies how many bits to read
	if firstNumber < 13 then
		return firstNumber
	elseif firstNumber == 13 then
		-- value 13 means that a following 5bit number describes the value
		return inputstream.readNumber(5)
	elseif firstNumber == 14 then
		-- value 14 means that a following 8bit number describes the value
		return inputstream.readNumber(8)
	elseif firstNumber == 15 then
		-- value 15 means that a following 16bit number describes the value
		return inputstream.readNumber(16)
	end
end
```


#### 4.1.5 HuffmanTree
Huffman Trees are encoded & serialized using a simple algorithm.  Consider the following Huffman Tree:

```
      /\
     /  \
    /    \
   /\     B
  /  \
 /    \
A     /\
     /  \
	/    \
   D      C
```

Encoded with UCG's algorithm, it would look like this:

```
0,
0, 1:B,
1:A, 0,
1:D, 1:C
```

Every entry of this list, so for example `1:B`, `1:C` or `0` is called an element. The Huffman Tree consists purely of
these elements. An element can either be a node (written as a `0` in this example) or a leaf (written as `1:B` or `1:A`,
etc in this example).

The first bit of every element describes if this element is a node or a leaf. If this first bit is 0, the element is a
node; if the first bit is 1, the element is a leaf. Only if the element is a leaf, a value follows. (in UCG, either a
`ColorValue` or a `LengthValue`, depending on the Huffman Tree you're currently reading/writing (see section 4)) The
Huffman tree encoding algorithm works by going down the Huffman Tree level by level, from the top to the bottom, and
writing the elements of the current level from the left to the right. The number of elements in the next level is twice
the number of nodes in the level before.

In the example above, the algorithm would start with the root of the Huffman Tree, which is a node; so it writes the
bit 0. It then goes to the next level, where it finds a node on the left, and a leaf with the value B on the right. So
it writes a 0, then a 1 followed by the binary value of B. In the next level, it finds a leaf with the value A and a
node, so it writes a 1 followed by the binary value of A and a 0. Finally, it gets to the last level, where it finds a
leaf with value D and a leaf with value C, so it encodes a 1 followed by the binary value of D and another 1 followed by
the binary value of C.

The decoder is now able to completely reconstruct the Huffman Tree, and is able to get the Huffman Code of each value by
going down the branches (the left/first branch is indexed by zero, the right/second branch is indexed with one). In some
rare cases, the root element of the Huffman Tree is a leaf. This means that its value is assigned a Huffman Code of zero
length, and no elements follow. There is no need to decode such a Huffman tree, since it can be automatically assumed
that the value equals the one given in the root element.

The Huffman Codes of the above example would look like this:

| Value | Huffman Code |
| ----- | ------------ |
| A     | 00           |
| B     | 1            |
| C     | 011          |
| D     | 010          |

With this tree:

```
       /\
      /  \
     /    \
    /     /\
   /     /  \
  /     / \  \
 /\    /\  \  \
7  8  9  A  B  0
```

the serialization would look like this:

```
0,
0, 0,
1:7, 1:8, 0, 1:0,
0, 1:B,
1:9, 1:A
```

The Huffman Codes of this example would look like this:

| Value | Huffman Code |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 7     | 00           |
| 8     | 01           |
| 9     | 1000         |
| A     | 1001         |
| B     | 101          |
| 0     | 11           |

An example Huffman Tree decoder written in Lua would look like this:

```lua
function readHuffmanTree(inputstream, readValue)
	if readBit() == 1 then
		-- return the value and a boolean which signals there is only 1 element in this tree
		return readValue(), true
	end
	local codes, toread, toread2 = {}, {0}
	local c0, c1

	while #toread > 0 do
		toread2 = {}

		for a = 1, #toread do
			huffmancode = toread[a]
			c0, c1 = {unpack(huffmancode)}, {unpack(huffmancode)}
			c0[#c0+1] = 0
			c1[#c1+1] = 1

			if readBit() == 1 then
				codes[c0] = readValue()
			else
				toread2[#toread2 +1] = c0
			end

			if readBit() == 1 then
				codes[c1] = readValue()
			else
				toread2[#toread2 +1] = c1
			end
		end
		toread = toread2
	end
	return codes
end
```

#### 4.1.6 PixelData
PixelData is an array that consists purely of so-called `LengthElement`s, the results of Run-length encoding. Each
`LengthElement` consists of a color Huffman Code, encoded in the color Huffman Tree (see section 4), followed by a
length Huffman Code, which is encoded in the length Huffman Tree (see section 4). The value of the color Huffman Code
equals the color of the array of pixels that this `LengthElement` describes, while the value of the length Huffman Code
equals the number of pixels that this `LengthElement` describes.

Let's assume we have the following `LengthElement`: `{4, 31}`. This means that 31 pixels with the color "4" follow after
the current position. To know if you should switch to the next line, you add the lengths of every `LengthElement` in the
current line together and check if it equals the Width of the image. If it does, the following `LengthElement`s describe
the next line of the image.  In cases where the root element of a Huffman Tree is a leaf, there is no entry of this
type. For example, if the root element of the color Huffman Tree is a leaf, no `LengthElement` in the PixelData has a
color attribute and only consists of a length attribute. (in this case, the length attribute would equal the width of
the image every time, and the LengthTree would only consist of one element, which means that you don't need to write any
`LengthElement` at all, and there is no content in the PixelData block at all.)

If you finished encoding the PixelData and the total number of bits of the file is not divisible by 8, a series of
zeroes or ones follows to fill up the last byte.

## 5. Explanation
### 5.1 Signature
The signature (hex number `0xFF2137`) is included in the file to check if this file is really in UCG format. Every UCG
file of version 1.0.0 and earlier has this 3 byte signature at the start of the file. Future UCG versions are supposed
to use the same signature.

### 5.2 Version
The version (`0x01` = decimal 1) describes the UCG version used to encode this file. Every UCG file of every version has
this 1 byte version record following after the signature.  For UCG123 files, a 123 would be there. This specification
**only** describes how to decode UCG1 images. In case you read a file where this version byte equals any number other
than 1, this specification is completely useless.

### 5.3 Flags
The Flags byte is currently unused.

### 5.4 Width
This 2 byte number describes the width (in pixels) of the image.

### 5.5 Height
This 2 byte number describes the height (in pixels) of the image.

### 5.6 ColorHuffmanTree
A Huffman Tree (see section 4.1.5) that assigns every color its Huffman Code for usage in the PixelData block. The
values of this Huffman Tree are encoded as `ColorValue`s. (see section 4.1.3)

### 5.7 LengthHuffmanTree
A Huffman Tree (see section 4.1.5) that assigns every length its Huffman Code for usage in the PixelData block. The
length values are a result of the RLE (Run-length encoding) done by the encoder. The values of this Huffman Tree are
encoded as `LengthValue`s. (see section 4.1.4)

### 5.8 PixelData
This is the block that contains the real content of the image. This makes the biggest part of the file.

### 5.9 Huffman Codes
Huffman Codes are individually sized binary codes.  The technique of Huffman Coding assigns more common used values a
shorter Huffman Code and less used values a longer Huffman Code in order to optimize the file size.

A simple example: The character "A" is used 10 times in a file, the character "B" is used 3 times and the character "C"
appears only once. A character is 1 byte large, which means that 14 bytes would have to be used to store the text
without any encoding.  Using Huffman coding, said file could be stored much more efficiently. The algorithm would assign
the character A the Huffman Code of `0`, the character B the Huffman Code `10` and the character C the Huffman Code
`11`.  The total size of the file (without the Huffman Tree that has to written first, so that the decoder knows the
Huffman Codes) using these codes would be 18 bits. Using the Huffman Tree serialization algorithm UCG uses, the Huffman
Tree would take 29 bits. That makes a total of 47 bits, or about 6 bytes.
